## 🔍 Introduction

This repository contains the official implementation and benchmark dataset for our **AAAI 26** paper: **Paper Folding Puzzles (PFP)** - a novel benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance visual reasoning and spatial intelligence in AI systems.

> Paper folding puzzles represent a fundamental challenge in visual reasoning, requiring models to understand geometric transformations, spatial relationships, and sequential reasoning. Our comprehensive benchmark provides a systematic framework for evaluating these capabilities across multiple complexity levels.

## 📋 Overview

**Paper Folding Puzzles** offer a unique lens into visual reasoning capabilities, testing:
- **Spatial Transformation Understanding**: How models comprehend geometric changes
- **Sequential Reasoning**: Following multi-step folding procedures  
- **Visual Pattern Recognition**: Identifying patterns in folded configurations
- **3D Spatial Visualization**: Mental reconstruction of 2D to 3D transformations

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Comprehensive Benchmark**: Multi-level puzzle complexity from basic to advanced
- **Rich Dataset**: Diverse paper folding scenarios with detailed annotations
- **Evaluation Framework**: Systematic assessment of visual reasoning capabilities
- **Scalable Generation**: Automated dataset creation for extensive testing
